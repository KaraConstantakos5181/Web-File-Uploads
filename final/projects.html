            <p> My world is the NamasteWorldMatrix my goal in this world was to make it similar to a peaceful Buddhist world but with a matrix spin. I have trees, temples, a buddha, and a moving globe down the matrix path. The idea is for the user to follow to moving globe down the matrix path and reach the buddha, reach peace! </p>
